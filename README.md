#Learning Spring Boot

This repository is designed to help me and others who share my approach to learn Spring Boot in an organized manner through a series of small projects.

The idea for this repository came to me after completing the MOOC.fi Java Part I and II courses. Prior to that, I took several Udemy courses on Linux, Python, and general web development.

I believe in the effectiveness of learning through many small projects. Although this approach may take more time, I am committed to the journey. Learning is not a sprint (even though I plan my daily/weekly activities in sprints!), but a marathon.
